## Introduction
{:#introduction}

The requirement for data interoperability has driven the development of many conceptual models used for structuring knowledge graphs. In the field of digital humanities we can think of [CIDOC-CRM](cite:cites cidoccrm) for culturage heritage, [LRM](cite:cites lrm) for libraries, or [RIC-CM](cite:cites ric-cm) and [RIC-O](cite:cites ric-o) for archives. The knowledge graphs based on these ontologies are accessible either using programmatic interfaces (SPARQL endpoint), or sometimes they underly other search systems, typically "multicriteria query forms" or faceted search engines.

Data interoperability and data aggregation from silos in a homogeneous graph require a lot of efforts, at the intellectual, business process and technical levels. These efforts are hard to explain and demonstrate, because no good solution exists to actually make the graph *tangible* for managers and *accessible* for end-users : SPARQL endpoints are too technical, and search systems look like "simple" search systems and do not show the graph.
