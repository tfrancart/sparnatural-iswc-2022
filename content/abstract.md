## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
Knowledge Graphs are often relying on conceptual models with a high level of abstraction, making them hard to understand for non-expert users, and are often hidden behind search forms, loosing the flexibility to interact with the graph *as a graph*.
<!-- Need         -->
Hence there is a need to shorten the distance between knowledge graphs and end users, in order to leverage the flexibility offered by the graph structure.
<!-- Task         -->
Sparnatural was designed and developped as a visual, configurable, easily deployable, open-source, cient-side SPARQL query builder, allowing users to query any RDF knowledge graph.
<!-- Object       -->
We describe here how Sparnatural works, how it can be configured, and we show how it was deployed in two demonstrators for the *Archives Nationales de France* (ANF) and *Biblioth√®que Nationale de France* (BNF).
<!-- Findings     -->
We show how Sparnatural has make it possible to give access to non-expert users, with a limited effort, to these two large graphs.


<!-- Conclusion   -->
The workshops conducted with end-users during the building of the two demonstrators showed that users were enthusiastics about the possibility it offered, but also revealed that this novel search paradigm is surprising and could benefit from user onboarding.
<!-- Perspectives -->
How Sparnatural is configured is key in providing an efficient access to the graph; we plan to work on semi-automated configuration generation from the graph structure, as well as adding new value selection widgets such as geographical area selection to generate GeoSPARQL queries.
